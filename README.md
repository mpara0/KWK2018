# KWK2018

Below, are some of the projects I worked on during the 2018 Kode With Klossy Camp.

Although these projects are very silly, these are some of the projects that helped me understand some core concepts and syntax in the Ruby Language. 

Here is a brief description of each project:

# MADLIB GENERATOR
Applying the concepts of conditionals, defining methods, and user input in Ruby- I created a mini MadLib game in the command line, where the computer takes user input, saved as a variable, and appears on the command line. Only Option A and B works

# snackCaclulator
Random snack calculator that takes the integer length of the string (user input) and spits out what snack the user should have based on the calculations.

# FizzBuzz

Determines what number is "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz" 

# FINAL PROJECT: One Humanity
