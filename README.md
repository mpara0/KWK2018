# Kode With Klossy 2018 SHECAGO 

Below, are some of the projects I worked on during the 2018 Kode With Klossy Camp.

Although these projects are very silly, these are some of the projects that helped me understand some core concepts and syntax in the Ruby Language. 

Here is a brief description of each project:

# Madlib Generator
Applying the concepts of conditionals, defining methods, and user input in Ruby- I created a mini MadLib game in the command line, where the computer takes user input, saved as a variable, and appears on the command line. Only Option A and B works

# snackCaclulator
Random snack calculator that takes the integer length of the string (user input) and spits out what snack the user should have based on the calculations.

# <a href = "http://one-humanity.herokuapp.com/"> FizzBuzz</a>

Determines what number is "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz" 

# FINAL PROJECT: <a href = "http://one-humanity.herokuapp.com/"> One Humanity </a>
Description: I lead a group of 4 girls to develop a web application that connects users to different non-profits by completing a quiz. The tools that were used in the project were HTML/CSS/Ruby and domain is ran under Herokuapp. In terms of my contributions to the project, I lead the idealization of One Humanity such as wire-framing and primarily focused on the Front-End development of the site using HTML/CSS. Helped with bugs on the backend for the quiz
